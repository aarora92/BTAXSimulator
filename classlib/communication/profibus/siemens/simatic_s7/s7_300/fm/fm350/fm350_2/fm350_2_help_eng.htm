<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><DFN><P>continuous_count:</P>
</DFN><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>The counter_device counts infinitely in this operating mode from current counter reading (initial_value). The initial value is set as default to 0.&#9;Did the counter achieve the upper counting boundary and does a further metering pulse come in such a way, the counter jumps onto the lower counting boundary and does it begin again to sum up the metering pulses; therefore, he further counts infinitely.&#9;The counter achieved the lower counting boundary and a further metering pulse comes in such a way, he jumps onto the upper counting boundary and count further from there from backwards.</P>
<P>The valid counting area is between -2147483648 to 2147483647 (-231 to 231-1). They can not modify this counting area.</P>
<P>Reference: This operating mode is the default setting of FM350-2 for all 8 channels.</P>
<P>You can also employ the HW_gate besides to the SW_gate. Both gates then perform as a logic AND-operation. If one of the gates is closed, the counting process can either broken off (i.e. the next counting process after opening the gate begins with 0) or intermittent are (i.e. the next counting course of process begins at the current count).</P>

Does the tally achieve value 1 in main counting direction backwards and does a further metering pulse come in such a way, the counter is put to the initial value and the counting course of events ended.

</FONT><DFN><P>Frequency_measurement:</P>
</DFN><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>In this operating mode, the counter counts the impulses which arrive in a parameterized time window (n x 10 ms).</P>
<P>They can adjust the length of the time window (10 msec to 10 sec) as well as of two frequency comparative values (an upper and a lower boundary value). The value of frequency is posted at the end of every time window. If no valid value was still determined, -1 is reported back. If no impulses are counted in a time period, the unit provides with 0 Hz*10-3. You can also employ the HW gate in addition to the SW gate. Both gates then perform as a logic AND-operation. If one of the gates is closed, the counting course of events can either broken off (i.e. the next counting course of events after opening the gate begins with 0) or intermittent are (i.e. the next counting course of events begins at the current count).</P>
<P>Range of values: The valid value range is between 0 and 214748648 times 10-3 Hz.</P>
<P>They can parameterize two frequency comparative values, a lower boundary value and an upper boundary value.</P>
<P>The value range for the lower boundary value is 0 to 9999999 times 10-3 Hz.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;The &lt;M[knack numeric value]&gt; is posted at the end of every &lt;M[time window]&gt;. You receive the determined frequency in the unit of 1 times 10-3 r.p.m. If no valid value was still determined, -1 is reported back. If no impulses are &lt;A[counted|depended]&gt; in a time period, the unit supplies 0 times 10-3 r.p.m.</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;They can also employ the &lt;M[HW gate]&gt; &lt;A[besides|in addition]&gt; to the &lt;M[SW gate]&gt;. Both gates then perform as a logic AND-operation.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&lt;M[Period measurement]&gt;:</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;In this operating mode, the &lt;M[tally unit]&gt; does without the exact time between two increasing flanks of the &lt;M[&lt;A[counting|depending]&gt; signal]&gt; when &lt;A[it|she]&gt; &lt;A[counts|depends]&gt; the impulses of an intern crystal-controlled reference frequency (1 MHz).</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;The period can only be registered in the adjusted &lt;M[main &lt;A[counting|depending]&gt; direction]&gt;. If a &lt;M[&lt;A[counting|depending]&gt; route reversal]&gt; occurs during the &lt;M[period measurement]&gt;, measurement is ended and value -1 is returned.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;They can only select this operating mode for a channel which you put on in the menu "specify channels" as &lt;M[proportioning tallies]&gt;.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;They can adjust one of 3 possible reflexes at attaining a comparative value.</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;2.&#9;Select whether you would like to adjust replacement values. In the operating mode "proportioning", you can adjust up to four replacement values, in the other &lt;M[&lt;A[counting|depending]&gt; operating modes]&gt;, you can adjust a replacement value.</P>
